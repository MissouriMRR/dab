# MRR Drone Controller

Let go of your physical controller and let the drone do the work. Contains two modes, production and debug.

Production has four start buttons for four drones. The drone software takes care of the rest.

Debug lets you takeoff, move, and land the drone without handling that physical controller.

Still, keep the physical controller just for that killswitch, even though there's also one built into this app.
